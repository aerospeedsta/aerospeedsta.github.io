title: "FNO Reachability Analysis"
description: "A research project on using Fourier Neural Operators for reachability."
date: 2023-10-25
project_id: "fno-reachability"
abstract: "This project explores the application of Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) to approximate the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi reachability equations. By learning the operator mapping from initial conditions to the value function, we aim to achieve real-time reachability analysis for high-dimensional systems."
